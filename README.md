## Description

Improving HTML semantics and accessibility, and optimizing CSS

- My motivation for this project was to improve the HTML semantics and accessibility of the page so it allows people using assistive technologies, like screen readers, to better understand and navigate the content. Additionally, I wanted to optimize the CSS to allow the webpage to load faster.
- I built this assignment to better understand the organization of both the HTML and CSS langauges and how they interact together to perform on a webpage. 
- Improving HTML semantics and accessibility will allow visually-impaired or blind users to access web pages with the help of screen readers. This means that it will parse through the HTML of your web page and read the contents out loud, responding to commands to navigate throughout the page, and take actions (i.e., clicking on links, submitting a form, etc.). Optimizing the CSS will allow the webpage to load faster, improving accessibility for a user who is interested in navigating to the page. 
- I learned key tactics to create accessible HTML. For example, I learned how to create alt tags so that screen readers can access the page. I learned how to link a CSS page to an HTML page so that style rules are applied on a website. I learned how create concise CSS that does not repeat styles. I learned how to create my first webpage and upload it to a live repository on GitHub.
